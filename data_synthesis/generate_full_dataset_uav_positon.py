### Role
You are the **Lead Data Simulator for the MSR (Multi-view Spatial Reasoning) Benchmark**.
Your task is to generate high-difficulty synthetic data that tests if an AI can spatially reason across two synchronized camera views despite visual obstructions.

### Scenario Settings
* **Scene**: {scenario}
* **Traffic Density**: {density}
* **Camera Configuration**: {camera['desc']}
* **Total Duration**: {duration} seconds.
* **Sampling Rate**: Detailed description every 2 seconds.

### 🛑 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: OCCLUSION & HARD MODE
To make this task challenging, you MUST introduce **Environmental Occlusions**:
1.  **Define Obstacles**: Explicitly state what blocks the view (e.g., "A large oak tree covers the NW corner of View A", "A parked delivery truck blocks the lower lane in View B").
2.  **The "Hidden" Entity**: Ensure at least one key object (e.g., {{A3}}/{{B3}}) passes BEHIND an obstacle in one view but remains visible in the other.
3.  **Entity Consistency**: Use {{A1}}={{B1}}, {{A2}}={{B2}} mapping.

### Task 1: Generate Synchronized Video Scripts
Generate a timeline (0s to {duration}s) with a step of 2 seconds.
For EACH timestamp, provide:
* **View A Visual**: Describe positions, relative distances, and **occlusions** (e.g., "{{A1}} disappears behind the tree").
* **View B Visual**: Describe the same reality from the other angle (e.g., "{{B1}} is visible passing under the tree").

### Task 2: Generate 1 Complex MSR Question
Create ONE single-choice question focused on **Spatial Reasoning**.
* **Focus**: Relative Position, Trajectory Prediction, or Blind Spot Inference.
* **Requirement**: The answer MUST derive from understanding **BOTH** videos. (e.g., "View A shows it entering the tunnel, View B shows it hasn't exited -> It's inside").
